$(fileinfo) Version $(version)

by $(author)

Generates a number of possible output files from a LaTeX document and its
various dependencies.  Handles .bib files, \include and \input, and .eps
graphics.  All dependencies are handled automatically by running LaTeX over
the source.

USAGE:

   make [GRAY=1] [VERBOSE=1] [SHELL_DEBUG=1] <target(s)>

STANDARD OPTIONS:
   GRAY:
       Setting this variable forces all recompiled graphics to be grayscale.
       It is useful when creating a document for printing.  The default is
       to allow colors.  Note that it only changes graphics that need to be
       rebuilt!  It is usually a good idea to do a 'make clean' first.

   VERBOSE:
       This turns off all @ prefixes for commands invoked by make.  Thus,
       you get to see all of the gory details of what is going on.

   SHELL_DEBUG:
       This enables the -x option for sh, meaning that everything it does is
       echoed to stderr.  This is particularly useful for debugging
       what is going on in $$(shell ...) invocations.  One of my favorite
       debugging tricks is to do this:

       make -d SHELL_DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | less

   KEEP_TEMP:
       When set, this allows .make and other temporary files to stick around
       long enough to do some debugging.  This can be useful when trying to
       figure out why gnuplot is not doing the right things, for example
       (e.g., look for *head.make).

STANDARD AUXILIARY FILES:

     Variables.ini (formerly Makefile.ini, which still works)

         This file can contain variable declarations that override various
         aspects of the makefile.  For example, one might specify

         neverclean := *.pdf *.ps
         onlysources.tex := main.tex
         LATEX_COLOR_WARNING := 'bold red uline'

         And this would override the neverclean setting to ensure that pdf
         and ps files always remain behind, set the makefile to treat all
         .tex files that are not "main.tex" as includes (and therefore not
         default targets).  It also changes the LaTeX warning output to be
         red, bold, and underlined.

         There are numerous variables in this file that can be overridden in
         this way.  Search for '?=' to find them all.

         The Variables.ini is imported before *anything else* is done, so go
         wild with your ideas for changes to this makefile in there.  It
         makes it easy to test them before submitting patches.

         If you're adding rules or targets, however, see Targets.ini below.

     Targets.ini

         This is included much later in the makefile, after all variables and
         targets are defined.  This is where you would put new make rules,
         e.g.,

         generated.tex: generating_script.weird_lang depA depB
            ./generating_script.weird_lang > $$@

         In this file, you have access to all of the variables that the
         makefile creates, like $(onlysources.tex).  While accessing those can
         be somewhat brittle (they are implementation details and may change),
         it is a great way to test your ideas when submitting feature requests.

STANDARD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

     LATEX_COLOR_WARNING        '$(LATEX_COLOR_WARNING)'
     LATEX_COLOR_ERROR          '$(LATEX_COLOR_ERROR)'
     LATEX_COLOR_UNDERFULL      '$(LATEX_COLOR_UNDERFULL)'
     LATEX_COLOR_OVERFULL       '$(LATEX_COLOR_OVERFULL)'
     LATEX_COLOR_PAGES          '$(LATEX_COLOR_PAGES)'
     LATEX_COLOR_BUILD          '$(LATEX_COLOR_BUILD)'
     LATEX_COLOR_GRAPHIC        '$(LATEX_COLOR_GRAPHIC)'
     LATEX_COLOR_DEP            '$(LATEX_COLOR_DEP)'
     LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS        '$(LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS)'
     LATEX_COLOR_FAILURE        '$(LATEX_COLOR_FAILURE)'

  These may be redefined in your environment to be any of the following:

     black
     red
     green
     yellow
     blue
     magenta
     cyan
     white

  Bold or underline may be used, as well, either alone or in combination
  with colors:

     bold
     uline

  Order is not important.  You may want, for example, to specify:

  export LATEX_COLOR_SUCCESS='bold blue uline'

  in your .bashrc file.  I don't know why, but you may want to.

STANDARD TARGETS:

   all:
       Make all possible documents in this directory.  The documents are
       determined by scanning for .tex and .tex.sh (described in more detail
       later) and omitting any file that ends in ._include_.tex or
       ._nobuild_.tex.  The output is a set of .pdf files.

       If you wish to omit files without naming them with the special
       underscore names, set the following near the top of the Makefile,
       or (this is recommended) within a Makefile.ini in the same directory:

        includes.tex := file1.tex file2.tex

       This will cause the files listed to be considered as include files.

       If you have only few source files, you can set

        onlysources.tex := main.tex

       This will cause only the source files listed to be considered in
       dependency detection.  All other .tex files will be considered as
       include files.  Note that these options work for *any* source type,
       so you could do something similar with includes.gpi, for example.
       Note that this works for *any valid source* target.  All of the
       onlysources.* variables are commented out in the shipping version of
       this file, so it does the right thing when they simply don't exist.
       The comments are purely documentation.  If you know, for example, that
       file.mycoolformat is supported by this Makefile, but don't see the
       "onlysources.mycoolformat" declared in the comments, that doesn't mean
       you can't use it.  Go ahead and set "onlysources.mycoolformat" and it
       should do the right thing.

   show:
       Builds and displays all documents in this directory.  It uses the
       environment-overridable value of VIEW_PDF (currently $(VIEW_PDF)) to
       do its work.

   all-graphics:
       Make all of the graphics in this directory.

   all-pstex (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
       Build all fig files into pstex and pstex_t files.  Gray DOES NOT WORK.

   all-gray-pstex (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
         Build all fig files into grayscale pstex and pstex_t files.

   all-dot2tex:
         Build all dot files into tex files.

   show-graphics:
       Builds and displays all graphics in this directory.  Uses the
       environment-overridable value of VIEW_GRAPHICS (currently
       $(VIEW_GRAPHICS)) to do its work.

   clean:
       Remove ALL generated files, leaving only source intact.
       This will *always* skip files mentioned in the "neverclean" variable,
       either in this file or specified in Makefile.ini:

        neverclean := *.pdf *.ps

      The neverclean variable works on all "clean" targets below, as well.

   clean-graphics:
       Remove all generated graphics files.

   clean-backups:
       Remove all backup files: $(backup_patterns)
       (XFig and other editors have a nasty habit of leaving them around)
       Also removes Makefile-generated .temp files

   clean-tex:
       Remove all files generated from LaTeX invocations except dependency
       information.  Leaves graphics alone.

   clean-deps:
       Removes all auto-generated dependency information.

   clean-auxiliary:
       Removes extra files created by various targets (like the dependency
       graph output).

   clean-nographics:
       Cleans everything *except* the graphics files.

   help:
       This help text.

   version:
       Version information about this LaTeX makefile.

DEBUG TARGETS:

   _all_programs:
       A list of the programs used by this makefile.

   _check_programs:
       Checks your system for the needed software and reports what it finds.

   _check_gpi_files:
       Checks the .gpi files in the current directory for common errors, such
       as specification of the terminal or output file inside of the gpi file
       itself.

   _dependency_graph:
       Outputs a .dot file to stdout that represents a graph of LaTeX
       dependencies.  To see it, use the _show_dependency_graph target or
       direct the output to a file, run dot on it, and view the output, e.g.:

       make _dependency_graph > graph.dot
       dot -T ps -o graph.eps graph.dot
       gv graph.eps

   _show_dependency_graph:
       Makes viewing the graph simple: extracts, builds and displays the
       dependency graph given in the _dependency_graph target using the value
       of the environment-overridable VIEW_POSTSCRIPT variable (currently set
       to $(VIEW_POSTSCRIPT)).  The postscript viewer is used because it
       makes it easier to zoom in on the graph, a critical ability for
       something so dense and mysterious.

   _all_sources:
       List all .tex files in this directory.

   _sources:
       Print out a list of all compilable sources in this directory.  This is
       useful for determining what make thinks it will be using as the
       primary source for 'make all'.

   _scripts:
       Print out a list of scripts that make knows can be used to generate
       .tex files (described later).

   _all_stems:
       Print a list of stems.  These represent bare targets that can be
       executed.  Listing <stem> as a bare target will produce <stem>.pdf.

   _includes:
       A list of .d files that would be included in this run if _includes
       weren't specified.  This target may be used alone or in conjunction
       with other targets.

   _graphic_outputs:
       A list of all generated .eps files

   _env:
       A list of environment variables and their values.  If supported by
       your version of make, also a list of variables known to make.

FILE TARGETS:

   %, %.pdf:
       Build a PDF file from the corresponding %.tex file.

       If BUILD_STRATEGY=pdflatex, then this builds the pdf directly.
       Otherwise, it uses this old-school but effective approach:

           latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf

       The BUILD_STRATEGY can be overridden in Makefile.ini in the same
       directory.  The default is pdflatex.

       Reasons for using latex -> dvips include the "psfrag" package, and the
       generation of postscript instead of PDF.  Arguments for using pdflatex
       include "new and shiny" and "better supported."  I can't argue with
       either of those, and supporting them both didn't turn out to be that
       difficult, so there you have it.  Choices.

   %._show:
       A phony target that builds the pdf file and then displays it using the
       environment-overridable value of VIEW_PDF ($(VIEW_PDF)).

   %._graphics:
       A phony target that generates all graphics on which %.pdf (or %.dvi)
       depends.

   %.ps (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
       Build a Postscript file from the corresponding %.tex file.
       This is done using dvips.  Paper size is automatically
       extracted from the declaration

       \documentclass[<something>paper]

       or it is the system default.

       If using beamer (an excellent presentation class), the paper
       size is ignored.  More on this later.

   %.dvi (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
       Build the DVI file from the corresponding %.tex file.

   %.ind:
       Build the index for this %.tex file.

   %.gls:
       Build the nomenclature glossary for this %.tex file.

   %.nls:
       Build the (newer) nomenclature file for this %.tex file.

   %.eps:
       Build an eps file from one of the following file types:

      .dot    : graphviz
      .gpi    : gnuplot
      .fig    : xfig
      .xvg    : xmgrace
      .svg    : scalable vector graphics (goes through inkscape)
      .png    : png (goes through NetPBM)
      .jpg      : jpeg (goes through ImageMagick)
      .eps.gz : gzipped eps

      The behavior of this makefile with each type is described in
      its own section below.

   %.pstex{,_t} (only for BUILD_STRATEGY=latex):
      Build a .pstex_t file from a .fig file.

FEATURES:

   Optional Binary Directory:
       If you create the _out_ directory in the same place as the makefile,
       it will automatically be used as a dumping ground for .pdf (or .dvi,
       .ps, and .pdf) output files.

       Alternatively, you can set the BINARY_TARGET_DIR variable, either as a
       make argument or in Makefile.ini, to point to your directory of
       choice.  Note that no pathname wildcard expansion is done in the
       makefile, so make sure that the path is complete before going in
       there.  E.g., if you want to specify something in your home directory,
       use $$HOME/ instead of ~/ so that the shell expands it before it gets
       to the makefile.

   External Program Dependencies:
       Every external program used by the makefile is represented by an
       ALLCAPS variable at the top of this file.  This should allow you to
       make judgments about whether your system supports the use of this
       makefile.  The list is available in the ALL_PROGRAMS variable and,
       provided that you are using GNU make 3.80 or later (or you haven't
       renamed this file to something weird like "mylatexmakefile" and like
       invoking it with make -f) can be viewed using

       make _all_programs

       Additionally, the availability of these programs can be checked
       automatically for you by running

       make _check_programs

       The programs are categorized according to how important they are and
       what function they perform to help you decide which ones you really
       need.

   Colorized Output:
       The output of commands is colorized to highlight things that are often
       important to developers.  This includes {underfull,overfull}
       {h,v}boxes, general LaTeX Errors, each stage of document building, and
       the number of pages in the final document.  The colors are obtained
       using 'tput', so colorization should work pretty well on any terminal.

       The colors can be customized very simply by setting any of the
       LATEX_COLOR_<CONTEXT> variables in your environment (see above).

   Predecessors to TeX Files:
       Given a target <target>, if no <target>.tex file exists but a
       corresponding script or predecessor file exists, then appropriate
       action will be taken to generate the tex file.

       Currently supported script or predecessor languages are:

       sh:     %.tex.sh
       perl:   %.tex.pl
       python: %.tex.py

          Calls the script using the appropriate interpreter, assuming that
          its output is a .tex file.

          The script is called thus:

             <interpreter> <script file name> <target tex file>

          and therefore sees exactly one parameter: the name of the .tex
          file that it is to create.

          Why does this feature exist?  I ran into this while working on
          my paper dissertation.  I wrote a huge bash script that used a
          lot of sed to bring together existing papers in LaTeX.  It
          would have been nice had I had something like this to make my
          life easier, since as it stands I have to run the script and
          then build the document with make.  This feature provides hooks
          for complicated stuff that you may want to do, but that I have
          not considered.  It should work fine with included dependencies,
          too.

          Scripts are run every time make is invoked.  Some trickery is
          employed to make sure that multiple restarts of make don't cause
          them to be run again.

       reST: %.rst

          Runs the reST to LaTeX converter to generate a .tex file
          If it finds a file names _rststyle_._include_.tex, uses it as
          the "stylesheet" option to rst2latex.

          Note that this does not track sub-dependencies in rst files.  It
          assumes that the top-level rst file will change if you want a
          rebuild.

      literate Haskell: %.lhs

          Runs the lhs2tex program to generate a .tex file.

   Dependencies:

       In general, dependencies are extracted directly from LaTeX output on
       your document.  This includes

       *    Bibliography information
       *    \include or \input files (honoring \includeonly, too)
       *    Graphics files inserted by the graphicx package

       Where possible, all of these are built correctly and automatically.
       In the case of graphics files, these are generated from the following
       file types:

       GraphViz:      .dot
       GNUPlot:       .gpi
       XFig:          .fig
       XMgrace:       .xvg
       SVG:           .svg
       PNG:           .png
       JPEG:          .jpg
       GZipped EPS:   .eps.gz

       If the file exists as a .eps already, it is merely used (and will not
       be deleted by 'clean'!).

       LaTeX and BibTeX are invoked correctly and the "Rerun to get
       cross-references right" warning is heeded a reasonable number of
       times.  In my experience this is enough for even the most troublesome
       documents, but it can be easily changed (if LaTeX has to be run after
       BibTeX more than three times, it is likely that something is moving
       back and forth between pages, and no amount of LaTeXing will fix
       that).

       \includeonly is honored by this system, so files that are not
       specified there will not trigger a rebuild when changed.

   Beamer:
       A special TeX source comment is recognized by this makefile (only when
       BUILD_STRATEGY=latex, since this invokes psnup):

       %%[[:space:]]*BEAMER[[:space:]]*LARGE

       The presence of this comment forces the output of dvips through psnup
       to enlarge beamer slides to take up an entire letter-sized page.  This
       is particularly useful when printing transparencies or paper versions
       of the slides.  For some reason landscape orientation doesn't appear
       to work, though.

       If you want to put multiple slides on a page, use this option and then
       print using mpage, a2ps, or psnup to consolidate slides.  My personal
       favorite is a2ps, but your mileage may vary.

       When beamer is the document class, dvips does NOT receive a paper size
       command line attribute, since beamer does special things with sizes.

   GNUPlot Graphics:
       When creating a .gpi file, DO NOT INCLUDE the "set terminal" or "set
       output" commands!  The makefile will include terminal information for
       you.  Besides being unnecessary and potentially harmful, including the
       terminal definition in the .gpi file makes it harder for you, the one
       writing the document, to preview your graphics, e.g., with

          gnuplot -persist myfile.gpi

       so don't do specify a terminal or an output file in your .gpi files.

       When building a gpi file into an eps file, there are several features
       available to the document designer:

       Global Header:
           The makefile searches for the files in the variable GNUPLOT_GLOBAL
           in order:

           ($(GNUPLOT_GLOBAL))

           Only the first found is used.  All .gpi files in the directory are
           treated as though the contents of GNUPLOT_GLOBAL were directly
           included at the top of the file.

           NOTE: This includes special comments! (see below)

       Font Size:
           A special comment in a .gpi file (or a globally included file) of
           the form

           ## FONTSIZE=<number>

           will change the font size of the GPI output.  If font size is
           specified in both the global file and the GPI file, the
           specification in the individual GPI file is used.

       Grayscale Output:
           GNUplot files also support a special comment to force them to be
           output in grayscale *no matter what*:

           ## GRAY

           This is not generally advisable, since you can always create a
           grayscale document using the forms mentioned above.  But, if your
           plot simply must be grayscale even in a document that allows
           colors, this is how you do it.

   XFig Graphics:
           No special handling is done with XFig, except when a global
           grayscale method is used, e.g.

               make GRAY=1 document

           In these cases the .eps files is created using the -N switch to
           fig2dev to turn off color output.  (Only works with eps, not pstex
           output)

   GraphVis Graphics:
           Color settings are simply ignored here.  The 'dot' program is used
           to transform a .dot file into a .eps file.

           If you want, you can use the dot2tex program to convert dot files
           to tex graphics.  The default is to just call dot2tex with no
           arguments, but you can change the DOT2TEX definition to include
           options as needed (in your Makefile.ini).

           Note that, as with pstex, the makefile cannot use latex's own
           output to discover all missing dot_t (output) files, since anytime
           TeX includes TeX, it has to bail when it can't find the include
           file.  It can therefore only stop on the first missing file it
           discovers, and we can't get a large list of them out easily.

           So, the makefile errors out if it's missing an included dot_t
           file, then prompts the user to run this command manually:

               make all-dot2tex

   GZipped EPS Graphics:

       A .eps.gz file is sometimes a nice thing to have.  EPS files can get
       very large, especially when created from bitmaps (don't do this if you
       don't have to).  This makefile will unzip them (not in place) to
       create the appropriate EPS file.
