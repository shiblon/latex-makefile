We need to detect general cases where the command we are trying to execute is
not on the system.  This should be easy to test by overriding commands with
things that aren't there, e.g.,

DOT := fakedot

In this case, we get an error on stderr (which ends up in the log):

/bin/sh: fakedot: command not found

There are probably other cases like this that we should make test cases for so
that we can be sure coloring is working properly.
