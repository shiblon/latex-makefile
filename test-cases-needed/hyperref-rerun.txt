We need a test case for:

Package hyperref Warning: Rerun to get /PageLabels entry.

Note to self: The beanbasics.tex case causes this.

Right now it bails out with an error, which I am going to suppress.  But, we need a test case for it so that we can have the makefile do the right thing (rerun to do its stuff).
