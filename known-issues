* The following occurs:
  file with: \usepackage{named}\bibliographystyle{named}
  Compile
  change to: \usepackage{apalike}\bibliographystyle{apalike}
  Compile again -- BARF!

  The workaround: make clean-nographics; make

  Note that we may not be able to fix this.  LaTeX itself barfs
  on this, not the makefile.  The very first invocation of LaTeX
  (when something like this has happened) reads the existing .aux
  file and discovers invalid commands like \citeauthoryear that
  are only valid in the package that was just removed.  It then
  tries to parse them and explodes.  It's not at all clear to me
  how to fix this.  I tried removing the .aux files on the first
  run of LaTeX, but that necessarily requires more subsequent
  rebuilds on common edits.  There does not appear to be a
  graceful solution to this issue.
