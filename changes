Chris Monson (2010-03-22):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta7
* Issue 72: Fix latex/bibtex invocation order for annotated bib styles
* Fixed informational output to reflect which LaTeX run we're on
* Fixed graphic detection to include graphics that are already there in
    .d files
* Tightened up the .d file output to only make .d depend on graphic
    *source* files.  This means that building foo.d no longer
    builds all of the graphics files on which foo.tex depends.
    Had to use .SECONDEXPANSION trickery to make it work.
* Changed get-graphics to only accept a stem.
* Fixed build-once logic for scripted .tex to work better
* Made get-inputs sed script more maintainable.
* Moved Makefile.ini import up higher.

* Added a MISSING comment to the .d file if stuff isn't found - forces
    removal of .1st.make file, which often forces it to try again.
* Fixed broken graphics-target function
* Added sleep to .d file generation when stuff is missing - if it
    builds too fast, make doesn't realize it needs to be reloaded,
    and thus never discovers some deeper dependencies (especially
    evident when graphics are included from scripted include
    files).
Chris Monson (2010-03-17):

* Fixed make foo to work properly (recursively calls make foo.pdf)
* Fixed gpi -> pdf generation to not waste time building .eps *after*
    the pdf already exists.
* Changed log copies to include MAKE_RESTARTS as part of the name.
* Fixed missing include file detection (also makes use of the paragraph
    stuff) to detect missing scripted include files.
Chris Monson (2010-03-16):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta4
* issue 70: .pdf not moved out of the way properly on first
    compilation, resulting in early error detection failure.

    implementation was masking real errors.
Chris Monson (2010-03-15):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta3
* issue 71: Made the tput dependency optional
* issue 73: Made .tex targets not pull in .d files (building them from
    scripts should not require a .d)
* issue 74: Output a much saner error when a .aux file is not produced
    (e.g., when you are typing "make" without arguments in a
    directory with included .tex files that are not named with
    ._include_.)

    be hanging around

    like "sort"
Chris Monson (2010-03-10):

    MV if the files exist)

* Added dependency on expr

Chris Monson (2008-05-21):
* Bumped version to 2.1.20
* Added manual pstex compilation support (run make all-pstex first)

* Fixed the inputs generation to be much simpler and to use pipes.
* Added the dependency graph directly into the makefile.
* Changed flatten-aux to remove \@writefile \relax \newlabel, etc.
* Undid pipe changes with sed usage (BSD sed doesn't know -f-).
* Added a _check_programs target that tells you what your system has.
* Fixed an error in colorization that made unnecessary errors appear
* Added view targets.
* Updated help text.
* Augmented cookies so that .aux can trigger .bbl and .dvi rebuilds
* Added more informative error handling for dvips and ps2pdf
Chris Monson (2006-04-02):
* Bumped version to 2.0a6
* Added indirection to .bbl dependencies to avoid rebuilding .bbl files
* Streamlined the diff invocation to eliminate an existence test
* Removed special shell quote escape variables
* Moved includes to a more prominent location
* Fixed .inputs.make to not contain .aux files
* Fixed embedding to use a file instead of always grepping.
* Added *.make.temp to the list of cleanable files
* Fixed Ruby.  It should now be supported properly.
* Now differentiate between all, default, and buildable files.
* Fixed to bail out on serious errors.
* Revised the handling of includable files.  Still working on it.
Chris Monson (2006-03-31):
* Bumped version to 2.0a5
* Fixed a bug with LaTeX error detection (there can be spaces)
* Added .bbl support, simplifying everything and making it more correct
* Refactored some tests that muddy the code
* Did a little cleanup of some shell loops that can safely be make loops
* Added support for graphviz .dot files
* Made _all_programs output easier to read
* Added the ruby support that has long been advertised
* Font embedding was screwed up for PostScript -- now implicit
* Changed the generation of -gray.gpi files to a single command
* Changed any make-generated file that is not included from .d to .make
Chris Monson (2006-03-30):
* Bumped version to 2.0a4
* Fixed a bug with very long graphics file names
* Added a todo entry for epsfig support
* Fixed a bug paper size bug: sometimes more than one entry appears
* Fixed DVI build echoing to display the number instead of process ID
* DVI files are now removed on first invocation if ANY file is missing
* Added a simple grayscale approach: if a file ends with -gray.gpi, it
    is created from the corresponding .gpi file with a special
    comment ##GRAY in its header, which causes coloring to be
    turned off.
* Fixed a bug in the handling of .tex.sh files.  For some reason I had
    neglected to define file stems for scripted output.
* Removed a trailing ; from the %.graphics dependencies
* Added dvips embedding (I think it works, anyway)
Chris Monson (2006-03-29):
* Bumped version to 2.0a3
* Fixed error in make 3.79 with MAKEFILE_LIST usage
* Added the presumed filename to the _version output
* Added a vim macro for converting sed scripts to make commands
* Added gpi dependency support (plotting external files and loading gpi)
* Allow .gpi files to be ignored if called .include.gpi or .nobuild.gpi
* Fixed sed invocations where \+ was used.  BSD sed uses \{1,\}.
Chris Monson (2006-03-28):
* Bumped version to 2.0a2
* Added SHELL_DEBUG and VERBOSE options
* Changed the default shell back to /bin/sh (unset, in other words)
* Moved .PHONY declarations closer to their targets
* Moved help text into its own define block to obtain better formatting
* Removed need for double-entry when adding a new program invocation
* Moved .SECONDARY declaration closer to its relevant occurrence
* Commented things more heavily
* Added help text about setting terminal and output in gnuplot
* Created more fine-grained clean targets
* Added a %.graphics target that generates all of %'s graphics
* Killed backward-compatible graphics generation (e.g., eps.gpi=gpi.eps)
* For now, we're just GPL 2, not 3.  Maybe it will change later
* Made the version and svninfo into variables
Chris Monson (2006-03-27):
* Bumped version to 2.0a1
* Huge, sweeping changes -- automatic dependencies
