Chris Monson (2010-03-22):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta7
* Issue 72: Fix latex/bibtex invocation order for annotated bib styles
* Fixed informational output to reflect which LaTeX run we're on
* Fixed graphic detection to include graphics that are already there in
    .d files
* Tightened up the .d file output to only make .d depend on graphic
    *source* files.  This means that building foo.d no longer
    builds all of the graphics files on which foo.tex depends.
    Had to use .SECONDEXPANSION trickery to make it work.
* Changed get-graphics to only accept a stem.
* Fixed build-once logic for scripted .tex to work better
* Made get-inputs sed script more maintainable.
* Moved Makefile.ini import up higher.

* Added a MISSING comment to the .d file if stuff isn't found - forces
    removal of .1st.make file, which often forces it to try again.
* Fixed broken graphics-target function
* Added sleep to .d file generation when stuff is missing - if it
    builds too fast, make doesn't realize it needs to be reloaded,
    and thus never discovers some deeper dependencies (especially
    evident when graphics are included from scripted include
    files).

* Fixed gpi -> pdf generation to not waste time building .eps *after*
    the pdf already exists.
* Changed log copies to include MAKE_RESTARTS as part of the name.
* Fixed missing include file detection (also makes use of the paragraph
    stuff) to detect missing scripted include files.
Chris Monson (2010-03-16):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta4
* issue 70: .pdf not moved out of the way properly on first
    compilation, resulting in early error detection failure.

    implementation was masking real errors.
Chris Monson (2010-03-15):
* Bumped version to 2.2.0-beta3
* issue 71: Made the tput dependency optional
* issue 73: Made .tex targets not pull in .d files (building them from
    scripts should not require a .d)
* issue 74: Output a much saner error when a .aux file is not produced
    (e.g., when you are typing "make" without arguments in a
    directory with included .tex files that are not named with
    ._include_.)

    be hanging around

    like "sort"

* Added dependency on expr

Chris Monson (2008-05-21):
* Bumped version to 2.1.20
* Added manual pstex compilation support (run make all-pstex first)

* Fixed embedding to use a file instead of always grepping.
* Added *.make.temp to the list of cleanable files
* Fixed Ruby.  It should now be supported properly.
* Now differentiate between all, default, and buildable files.
* Fixed to bail out on serious errors.
* Revised the handling of includable files.  Still working on it.
Chris Monson (2006-03-31):
* Bumped version to 2.0a5
* Fixed a bug with LaTeX error detection (there can be spaces)
* Added .bbl support, simplifying everything and making it more correct
* Refactored some tests that muddy the code
* Did a little cleanup of some shell loops that can safely be make loops
* Added support for graphviz .dot files
* Made _all_programs output easier to read
* Added the ruby support that has long been advertised
* Font embedding was screwed up for PostScript -- now implicit
* Changed the generation of -gray.gpi files to a single command
* Changed any make-generated file that is not included from .d to .make
Chris Monson (2006-03-30):
* Bumped version to 2.0a4
* Fixed a bug with very long graphics file names
* Added a todo entry for epsfig support
* Fixed a bug paper size bug: sometimes more than one entry appears
* Fixed DVI build echoing to display the number instead of process ID
* DVI files are now removed on first invocation if ANY file is missing
* Added a simple grayscale approach: if a file ends with -gray.gpi, it
    is created from the corresponding .gpi file with a special
    comment ##GRAY in its header, which causes coloring to be
    turned off.
* Fixed a bug in the handling of .tex.sh files.  For some reason I had
    neglected to define file stems for scripted output.
* Removed a trailing ; from the %.graphics dependencies
* Added dvips embedding (I think it works, anyway)
Chris Monson (2006-03-29):
* Bumped version to 2.0a3
* Fixed error in make 3.79 with MAKEFILE_LIST usage
* Added the presumed filename to the _version output
* Added a vim macro for converting sed scripts to make commands
* Added gpi dependency support (plotting external files and loading gpi)
* Allow .gpi files to be ignored if called .include.gpi or .nobuild.gpi
* Fixed sed invocations where \+ was used.  BSD sed uses \{1,\}.
Chris Monson (2006-03-28):
* Bumped version to 2.0a2
* Added SHELL_DEBUG and VERBOSE options
* Changed the default shell back to /bin/sh (unset, in other words)
* Moved .PHONY declarations closer to their targets
* Moved help text into its own define block to obtain better formatting
* Removed need for double-entry when adding a new program invocation
* Moved .SECONDARY declaration closer to its relevant occurrence
* Commented things more heavily
* Added help text about setting terminal and output in gnuplot
* Created more fine-grained clean targets
* Added a %.graphics target that generates all of %'s graphics
* Killed backward-compatible graphics generation (e.g., eps.gpi=gpi.eps)
* For now, we're just GPL 2, not 3.  Maybe it will change later
* Made the version and svninfo into variables
Chris Monson (2006-03-27):
* Bumped version to 2.0a1
* Huge, sweeping changes -- automatic dependencies
